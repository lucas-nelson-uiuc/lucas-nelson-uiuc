Hello, Iâ€™m `@lucas-nelson-uiuc`, or Lucas Nelson.

Recently graduated from the University of Illinois with a degree in statistics. Working now as a data analyst where I roleplay as a *faux data engineer*.

Really enjoy working with processes that involve web applications (Shiny, Flask), although these are typically data-intensive applications. Interests include out-of-core processing, OLAP query engines, and all things automation.

After hours, I am an dvid cyclist, post-rock enjoyer, and Polars/DuckDB enthusiast.
