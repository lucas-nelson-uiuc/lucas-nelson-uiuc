Hello, Iâ€™m @lucas-nelson-uiuc, or Lucas Nelson.

I recently graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where I locked myself in the library reading Statistics and Econometrics textbooks. Although some of my repositories are academic-related, most stem from my own ideas and are curtailed for my consumption.

Feel free to roam any one of my repositories, and if anything stands out, let me know what you think!
