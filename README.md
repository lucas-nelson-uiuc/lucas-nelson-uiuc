Hello, I’m @lucas-nelson-uiuc, or Lucas Nelson.

Currently, I am a rising senior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Statistics and Econometrics.
I have always enjoyed trying to make sense of the world (even if I am wrong sometimes), and what better way to explore it than by picking apart
economic data using statistical methods?

After exploring automation via simulated games or web scraping bots I created, I would be ecstatic to collaborate on projects
that involve learning beyond the bot's script.

Feel free to roam any one of my repositories, and if anything stands out, let me know what you think!
