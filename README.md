Hello, Iâ€™m @lucas-nelson-uiuc, or Lucas Nelson.

Currently, I am a rising senior at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Statistics and Econometrics. Although some repositories are academic-related, most stem from my own ideas and are curtailed for my consumption.

Feel free to roam any one of my repositories, and if anything stands out, let me know what you think!
